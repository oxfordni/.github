<!-- A description of the issue goes here. Usually the more information, the better, but that doesn't mean walls of text. Conciseness, recordings, screenshots, links, etc. help you provide a lot of information without needing to write a lot. -->

## Acceptance criteria
<!-- List acceptance criteria here ... what should be true for this issue to be considered solved?

This is not a task list. Acceptance criteria are written from the point of view of a user. For example, "User should be able to paginate through analysis executions 50 at a time". 

If the user is an end-user rather than a developer, you can include what should be true about technical outputs like API contracts, database state, observability capabilities, etc.

Keep in mind that the solution will do the *least* possible to satisfy these criteria, so if something is necessary, list it here.

Acceptance criteria shouldn't cover the general engineering practices that are required to make a solution acceptable, like writing tests.
